# Food-System
This is a Node.js project for an API dealing with food ordering.
The API can currently can get a list of all of the items offered, can get an item by its id, and also delete/update/add an item.
The project uses mongoose to deal with the MongoDB Atlas cloud database.
I'm in the process of adding various other useful features to the API to facililate showing of stats, etc.
To make the project work, we have to edit in the MongoDB connection string, the MongoDB username and the corresponding in the config.env file.
